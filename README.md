# Workshop-zero
This is the introduction workshop into coding with getting familiarised with different shapes and different colours. 
In this workshop I was introduced to using P5.JS in creating different shapes, colours and sizes. 
The p5.js is truly easy to manage as it already contains the tools needed for drawing for example there are two function that is already set up to help the computer understand the instruction. This is function set up which helps in setting the area that needs to do the drawing and the function draw is where the art work is made.

I have chosen to draw different size  circles() which were big and small ones and with different colours. 
For function set up I didnt change anything. 
For function draw I have put in these codes. The coding for the shape circle is circle()

circle(100,200,150);
  fill(50,100,150);
  stroke(100)
  
  This was the coding for the **Blue circle**
  circle(300,50,100)
  fill(200,250,100)
  stroke(200);
  These were the coding for the **maroon colour circle **
  
  circle(150,50,100)
  fill(250,250,50);
 stroke(50);
These were the coding for the **highlighted green circle**
  circle(250,150,200);
  fill( 50,200,100);
  stroke(100);

  These were the coding for the **Big Yellow circle **
  
  circle(50,150,50);
  stroke(50);
  fill(200,60,100);
  These were the coding for the small green colour circle 

  **What was new that you have learned from the p5.js documentation?**
  - learning how to block the other coding so that you can work on the ones your after. This I was able to press command and forward slash using the Mac Book. This helps in identifying the different circle and their colours as coding does not classified the colours in words but in numbers.
In reverse you have to press the same key so that the block comes off.

I also finds it easier to work on the p5.js due to the reference page and the help that is given in our class workshop acknowledging our lecture explaining how to use the codes. 

**Recommended**: Beginners
